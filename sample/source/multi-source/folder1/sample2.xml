        <articleTitle>Building Engaging Customer Experiences Powered by MongoDB</articleTitle>
        <articleBody>&lt;p&gt;This spring and summer, the MongoDB Road Show stops in over 20 cities across the country to educate users on how MongoDB can be used to build modern business apps to improve the customer experience and accelerate time to market. Rivet Logic sponsored several of the cities and presented on the topic of building engaging customer experiences with MongoDB, discussing how a modern database can be used to better leverage existing data to derive business value. The next MongoDB Road Show is this Thursday, July 10, in San Francisco!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Organizations Need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Organizations seeking to build engaging customer experiences on the Web often have a similar set of goals. To start, they want to increase user adoption by providing an engaging experience that brings value to the end-user. This can lead to increased customer retention, allowing organizations to create loyal customers who can then become their own brand ambassadors.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moreover, organizations want to capitalize on their customers&#8217; and users&#8217; creativity and innovation by seamlessly weaving in the ability to collaborate, interact, and share into every aspect of the user experience. Businesses find the quality of this type of engagement to be particularly beneficial, due to its unpredictability. However, to enhance the value of these interactions, users need a motivator, meaning organizations need to create high quality content that&#8217;s personalized and targeted to each user&#8217;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While personas are great and have worked well to capture general types of users, in reality, users think of themselves more as individuals, with evolving interests over time. Organizations are now faced with delivering personalized experiences beyond a persona level and at an individual level.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&#8217;s the Problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;However, many organizations are having a hard time with this fine-grained personalization, and it&#8217;s largely due to the limiting technology they&#8217;re working with. IT teams are often faced with seemingly &#8220;impractical&#8221; features that business teams are requesting.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Organizations today are using separate systems like standalone content apps &#8211; blogs, forums, wikis, &#8211; commenting engines, traditional databases, and BI tools to enable user interaction and collect and analyze information about them. The quality of user interactions is largely driven by the quality of the user-generated content being collected and analyzed. However, since much of this valuable customer data is silo&#8217;d in disparate systems, it&#8217;s not allowing businesses to effectively leverage their existing data.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While many have attempted to find workarounds for this, there hasn&#8217;t been any real success in creating a coherent rich user interaction data set that brings value to all the delivery use cases available. For example, when a user joins the comment thread of a blog entry, they are unaware of the possibility of a forum thread that is discussing the same topic. In addition, these solutions are typically backed by traditional databases, which requires changing of the infrastructure to accommodate new use cases, posing a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fact is, the various types of interactions that exist today are disjointed, resulting in redundancy and little chance of connecting and leveraging them. It&#8217;s critical that we make these interactions context-aware, and the only way of effectively doing so is to have a holistic view of all the user-generated content that&#8217;s being collected, while also allowing the interactions to cross application boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pillars of a Good Solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Successful solutions that meet these challenges must adhere to the following pillars:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211; The solution must be implemented using technology agnostic building blocks. Being a certain type of shop (.Net, PHP, Windows, etc.) constrains organizations from using the right tools for the job. Using technology agnostic building blocks as the underlying infrastructure allows organizations to innovate and improve their business without being held back by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211; The solution must be scalable without sacrificing performance. There are many platforms out there that claim to be scalable, but what good is that when scaling means long page load times?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visibility&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211; It&#8217;s also extremely important to be able to know and see the overall picture and have a holistic view of user interactions that isn&#8217;t so low-level where it prevents you from seeing what they are doing (as is the case with auditing services).&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight&lt;/strong&gt; &#8211; Lastly, when you have rich, contextual data available in one place, organizations need to be able to leverage that information, innovate and provide new features, capability, and value to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;</articleBody>
